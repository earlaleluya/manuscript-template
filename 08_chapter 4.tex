    In this section, you will need to present and interpret your research findings. Begin by objectively reporting the results, using clear and concise language, tables, or figures to support your observations. Discuss the significance of the research question or hypothesis results, addressing any unexpected findings and their potential implications. Compare your results with relevant literature, highlighting similarities or differences. Consider the limitations of your study and suggest areas for future research. Engage in thoughtful analysis, providing context for the results and offering insights contributing to the topic's broader understanding. Encourage the reader to critically evaluate the study and its contributions while maintaining a logical flow between the presentation of results and their discussion.
