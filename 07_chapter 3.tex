    The research methodology section outlines the systematic approach and procedures to investigate the research questions or hypotheses. It encompasses the study's overall design, including the research paradigm, sampling techniques, data collection methods, and data analysis procedures. A detailed explanation of the chosen methodology, whether qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods approach, is provided, justifying its appropriateness for addressing the research objectives. The section also discusses ethical considerations, reliability, and validity measures, enhancing the transparency and credibility of the research. By elucidating the step-by-step process undertaken to gather and analyze data, the research methodology provides a blueprint for replication, allowing others in the field to assess the study's rigor and draw meaningful comparisons with similar research endeavors.

    \textit{Important Note:} Please outline your Methodology based on your objectives. Ask for guidance from your COE194 instructor, adviser, or panel member.
